## 1. Purpose of the Project

Design a website for people to do a quiz on movies.

### External user’s goal:

The site’s users want to play an online quiz to test specific knowledge about movies.

### Site owner’s goal: 

The goal of the site is to provide a challenging quiz to entertain online users,


## 2. User Stories

      1) As a user I want to do a quiz about movies.

      2) As a user I want to know what my score is for the quiz.

      3) As a user I want to see images if the answers are correct or incorrect.

      4) As a user I want to easily navigate around the site.

      5) As a user I want to be able to play the quiz on various devices. 

UX? Check on slack with Anna Greaves and Jim, also portfolio students

## 3. Features
I decided to use radio buttons for the quiz so as to give the user a feeling of  being in control and better navigation. 

## 4. Future Features

Possibility of creating a log in form for potential users with password access.

## 5. Typography and Colour Scheme

Checked up on what font is used at the movies and trajan  was the top one developed by Adobe.

### Backround Colour

The back ground colour for the whole site has been kept white for better visibility and simplicity.

### Navbar

I decided to do the navbar background colour to  rgba(185, 36, 9, 0.986) so that it would sharply contrast with the quiz background colour and the answer box.  I felt as that as both the quiz box and the answer box were light subtle colours that a navbar with a stronger colour would help it to stand out for the user for better visibility and to indicate that this was an important navigation function for the site.

I also realised that this darker shade of red was similar to the red seating found in cinemas.

### Logo and Nav Links Font

The logo and the nav links font colour was done in a off white rgb(238, 226, 226) because so as that it fitted in better with the whole site.  If I had used just white for these fonts they stood out to strongly with the white background colour of the whole site and the off white was more subtle and it gave the navbar better uniformity of being its own section on the site.

The background colour for the quiz box is #b3f1f3 a light blue so as to enable the user to focus on the questions in the box.
	
By contrast to the Quiz box, the background colour for the answer box has been set to #f3e1e1 a light pinkish shade so as to allow the user to know this is what the outcome answer is.

### Logo

I tried to add the cinzel style for the logo font, thinking it could give an authentic movie style font (cinzel is regarded as closest to Trajan font used mainly for the movies) however I felt it distorted the look of the website and it did not make it look consistent with the rest of the site.

### Hero Image

I decided to use an image of a cinema screen within the audotorium.  I felt it would intuitively let the user know that this is a quiz about movies and to use that image as a focus.  The image also complimented the navbar and footer background colour.  The blank white screen in the cinema also complimented the white background of the site.

### Footer 

The background colour for footer set to the same colour as the navbar  rgba(185, 36, 9, 0.986), so that it kept the same consistency for the user not to get distracted.  

The font colour for the social media links were set to the same colour as the loge navbar links rgb(238, 226, 226) so as to maintain consistency and uniformity.  I also wanted the user to intuitively know where the navlinks were and the social media links one being for navigation purposes and the other being accessible external links.

8. Testing

  8.1 code validation

  8.2 test cases (user story based with screenshots)

  8.3 fixed bugs
  Contacted tutors on 6th of September to identify problem with code in Javasript not opening burger menu.  The issue was an extra bracket not making the code execute properly.  I also checked on dev tools to identify the problem.

  Contacted tutors on the 7th of September to identify the problem with code in Javascript not loading the score board.  Problem identified in syntax bracket line 16 and 19 and after removing the bracket the problem was rectified.I
  
  On the 9th of September, I spoke to my mentor about the layout of the site and how I had to set up the quiz pages as separate files with separate script files with the answers. I explained that I had tried to use the code in one script but it caused a fault.  I had to find a solution and found that creating separate files helped to resolve the problem.  

  My mentor advised me to contact the tutors to look into see if I could use a loop in the code so that it was not being repeated.  

  I checked a tutorials on youtube regarding arrays and loops.

  on the 14th of September there was an error in the console log when clicking the start button.  The error was rectified by ensuring that the buttonStart and the welcome had a . infront of them in their querySelector brackets.

  I spoke to my mentor on the 14th of September and explained how I had tried to create a new project as I could understand how dry repetitive code in many files was not productive.  I explained that I had put a lot of effort into redisgning my project.  During my mid term review with my mentor I explained that I was still not happy with my project and that I would would need to go back to the drawing board and simplify what i could do for the project however I had learnt a lot through the process.
