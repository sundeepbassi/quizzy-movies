## 1. Purpose of the Project

Design a website for people to do a quiz on movies.

### External user’s goal:

The site’s users want to play an online quiz to test general/specific knowledge such as sports/movies/itenary knowledge or personality assessment.

### Site owner’s goal: 

The goal of the site is to provide a challenging quiz to entertain online users,


## 2. User Stories

      1) As a user I want to do a quiz about movies.

      2) As a user I want to know what my score is for the quiz.

      3) As a user I want to see images if the answers are correct or incorrect.

      4) As a user I want to be able to create a  username  .

      5) As a user I want to be able to give feedback.

      6) As a user I want to easily navigate around the site.

      7) As a user I want to be able to play the quiz on various devices. 

UX? Check on slack with Anna Greaves and Jim, also portfolio students

## 3. Features
I decided to use buttons for the quiz so as to give the user a feeling of  being in control and better navigation, I did not want to use radio buttons as i felt they did not give a feeling of pressing something.

## 4. Future Features

## 5. Typography and Colour Scheme

Checked up on what font is used at the movies and Janaka was the top one developed by Adobe.

I have thought that it would be a good idea to use a black backround as this would be similar to being in a cinema.  The white foreground colour was the best for the forefront colour and it would make it easy to read for people with visual impairment.





## 6. Wireframes

The wireframes layout was put together to enable one to see where to locate the various functions for the quiz.

The main title is at the top called Quizzy Movies.
I used this title as it was both fun and communicated directly to the user what the site is for.

Underneath the title there is information about the site.

The main question will be at the top of the first box area.

Then there is the answer area below the questions area,
The score is located to the right hand bottom side.

Feedback button is in the centre.

Signup is on the right hand bottom side.

Next button is at the bottom.

The layout was designed like this so that it would be user friendly.  The user could start playing the quiz straight away and the navigation was laid so that after the user played the quiz they would have the option to see the score, input feedback and sign up.  This is why these buttons were placed at the bottom.  

The layout needed to be simple and have the feeling of being uncluttered.  The next button was placed at the right hand bottom side so that if the user enjoyed the experience of playing this quiz then they could move onto the next question.

I wanted the user to have the feeling that they easily locate buttons on the site and not have any frustration in trying to find any of the functions.

I really needed to look at the user really wanted to do and how to incorporate on the site and the main functions only incorporated without any complications.

The answer to the question will be placed in a separate box that will show an image of the correct or incorrect answer and a statement at the bottom stating correct or incorrect.

There will also need to be a back button on the answer section so as to enable the user to go back to the question area if they are playing the game on other devices such as mobiles.

The inspiration to design with two boxes for  the site like this came from Kevin Briggs' youtube video.

9. Deployment

10. Credits

1) To set up the filing system, implement the boiler plate and the intial commit are accredited to the love maths video from the Code Institute.

2) The initial readme template was set up in Google docs and the layout was shared on the slack community by fellow students.  For this project I did my research and added it to the google docs template both for planning and adding relevant information for the project.
