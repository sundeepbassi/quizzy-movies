## 2. User Stories


## 3. Features

## 4. Future Features

Possibility of creating a log in form for potential users with password access.

## 5. Typography and Colour Scheme

Checked up on what font is used at the movies and trajan  was the top one developed by Adobe.

### Backround Colour

The back ground colour for the whole site has been kept white for better visibility and simplicity.


### Footer 

The background colour for footer set to the same colour as the navbar  rgba(185, 36, 9, 0.986), so that it kept the same consistency for the user not to get distracted.  

The font colour for the social media links were set to the same colour as the loge navbar links rgb(238, 226, 226) so as to maintain consistency and uniformity.  I also wanted the user to intuitively know where the navlinks were and the social media links one being for navigation purposes and the other being accessible external links.

8. Testing

  8.1 code validation

  8.2 test cases (user story based with screenshots)

  8.3 fixed bugs
  Contacted tutors on 6th of September to identify problem with code in Javasript not opening burger menu.  The issue was an extra bracket not making the code execute properly.  I also checked on dev tools to identify the problem.

  Contacted tutors on the 7th of September to identify the problem with code in Javascript not loading the score board.  Problem identified in syntax bracket line 16 and 19 and after removing the bracket the problem was rectified.I
  
  On the 9th of September, I spoke to my mentor about the layout of the site and how I had to set up the quiz pages as separate files with separate script files with the answers. I explained that I had tried to use the code in one script but it caused a fault.  I had to find a solution and found that creating separate files helped to resolve the problem.  

  My mentor advised me to contact the tutors to look into see if I could use a loop in the code so that it was not being repeated.  

  I checked a tutorials on youtube regarding arrays and loops.

  on the 14th of September there was an error in the console log when clicking the start button.  The error was rectified by ensuring that the buttonStart and the welcome had a . infront of them in their querySelector brackets.

  I spoke to my mentor on the 14th of September and explained how I had tried to create a new project as I could understand how dry repetitive code in many files was not productive.  I explained that I had put a lot of effort into redisgning my project.  During my mid term review with my mentor I explained that I was still not happy with my project and that I would would need to go back to the drawing board and simplify what i could do for the project however I had learnt a lot through the process.

  Checked on w3c Markup Validation service and 2 errors were reported in no closing div tag on line 13. This was rectified and another validation test was conducted and there were no errors or warnings.

  Checked on the W3C CSS validation service and I had to rectify 1 error.  The test was repeated and it passed successfully.
